					<p>In baseball, machine learning is often used to quantify a player&#39;s ability from a range of inputs. In this website, I&#39;m interested in replicating some models that explain a pitcher&#39;s value. Two ways a pitcher&#39;s value can be calculated are stuff and location. I built these models to better understand how this type of models work. Before I start I want to reference some other pages that really helped me to do this:</p>

					<h2 id="what-is-stuff-location-and-pitching-plus-">What is Stuff, Location, and Pitching Plus?</h2>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Stuff plus: it tries to quantify the value of a pitcher&#39;s pitch (one way a pitcher throws the ball) solely on its physical attributes like spin, velocity and release point.</li>
						<li>Location plus: it tries to quantify the pitcher&#39;s ability to put the pitches in the right place based on the count (the situation).</li>
						<li>Pitching plus: it tries to quantify the pitcher&#39;s overall pitching ability using the inputs from both stuff and location plus.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<br />
					<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
					<br />
					<p>The data came from Baseball Savant and it was downloaded using a <a href="https://github.com/enzdor/dl-bs">simple</a> script I wrote in Go, this script gives the data for a specific season in csv format. The rows of the csv file are all the pitches thrown during a season and the columns contain the data relating to them. The data that is going to be used are the physical characteristics of a pitch (for stuff plus), the location and count (for location plus) and the delta run expectancy which is the change in run expectancy before and after the specific pitch. The delta run expectancy is the varialbe that we are trying to predict, the &#39;y&#39;, while the other variables would be the &#39;x&#39;s, the regressors.</p>
					<br />
					<h2 id="script">Script</h2>
					<br />
					<p>The tool that was used to build these models was FLAML&#39;s automl (auto machine learning) which allows me to perform accurate regressions without having to worry about tuning the models. The estimator that was used for these models was XGBoost because it is widely used. Each of the three models (stuff, location, and pitching) is subdivided into three different groups according to pitch types: fastball, offspeed, and breaking. These three different general pitch type groups allow similar pitches to be compared to each other. For example, a four-seam fastball (a very fast pitch with little vertical and horizontal movement) will be compared to a two-seamer (a very fast pitch with some vertical and horizontal movement) but will not be compared to a curveball (slow pitch with lots of vertical movement) or a slider (slow pitch with lots of horizontal and vertical movement).</p>
					<br />
					<p>The whole program is divided into two different python files one is called ml_stuff.py and the other is called predict.py. In ml_stuff.py the models are created using the baseball savant data and FLAML's automl and then saved to a folder called models in the directory where the script was run. The predict.py loads the models and the baseball savant data and makes the predictions using the models. Then, it calculates stuff, location and pitching plus. The data is then saved to a sqlite3 database. Example:</p>
					<p><pre><code>
python3 ml_stuff.py baseballsavant242322.csv
python3 predict.py baseballsavant242322.csv
					</code></pre></p>
					<p>The models were created using data from the 2022, 2023 and 2024 seasons. This was done to have a very large sample, and it also helps to have just one model to make predictions with for all the past seasons up until 2015, which is when baseball savant data starts. All of the nine models were trained for nine hours each, which is probably overkill.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>You can find the source code for the script <a href="!https://github.com/enzdor/ss-py/">here</a>, you will find that there are some comments trying to explain what happens in each block of code.</p>

					<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
					<br />
					<p>All of the stuff, location, and pitching plus values for each pitcher can be seen in the home page of this website.</p>
					<br />
					<p>The first statistic we are going to look at is the stickiness of the stuff, location, and pitching plus. This is done by running a simple regression of the 2023 on the 2024, meaning we are trying to explain the results of the 2024 with the results of the 2023 to see how predictive the models are season to season.</p>
					<br />

					<br />
					<p>We can see in the table above that the R^2 for stuff plus and pitching plus are really high, while the one for location is negative. The former R^2s show that stuff and pitching plus are really sticky year to year, this is very good because it shows that there is some predictive value to the metric, but it doesn't mean that the predictions are good. The latter though is negative, this shows that you are better off using the mean of the 2024 data to make predictions of itself than 2023 data. This shows that this metric has little predictive value, we can also see differences in the graphs below that plot the relationship of the data between the two seasons.</p>

					<br />
					<p>Lastly, we are going to take a look at the feature importance for the stuff model, how significant is the effect of independent variable is on the dependent variable. We are going to do this only for the stuff model.</p>
					<br />

						</div>
					</div>
					<br />
					<p>In general, the three most relevant independent variables are release_pos_x, release_pos_z, vx0, vy0, and vz0. Below I provide a sketch with the axis, for you to better understand. release_pos is from where the ball is released while the &#39;v&#39; variables are the velocities of the pitch, in feet per second determined at y=50 feet. This shows that the models are most concerned with velocity and release point.</p>

							<img src="./src/xyz.png" alt="Sketch showing y axis is from pitcher to catcher, x axis is from 3rd to second base and z axis is from floor to the sky." \>
						</div>
					<br />
					<p>You can find out what all of the independent variables are in this <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs">link</a>. Below I will provide plots that show the relationship of the main five independent variables against the stuff, location, or pitching plus for each of the three different pitch type groups.</p>

					<br />
					<p>Here you can find the leaders for each of the three pitch type groups that have more than 100 pitches thrown for the corresponding pitch type. 100 is league average, if stuff plus is greater than 100, it means that the pitch is better than league average. For example, 110 is 10% better than league average. The same for values less than 100.</p>

					<p>You can probably tell that most of these pitchers are side arm throwers, the model seems to prefer pitchers with a low release_point_z. This may be due to the fact that there is no differentiation between lefties and righties in the model thus giving more importance to vertical release point. Why it likes low release points, I'm not sure.</p>
					<br />
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
					<br />
					<p>The stuff model is at least serviceable but it has an obvious preference for low release angles. There is also the fact that lefties and righties aren't differentiated, this may be adding to the problem. For the location models, which are probably unusable, one simple way of improving them in the future would be to add more information about the situation of the game when the pitch is thrown like the score and if there are any runners on base. Even if other location models do, I think its worth the try. All of the variable from the location and stuff model can be added to the pitching model too. The problem with the pitching model right now is that it is not so different from the stuff model as the current variables have little explicative power no. </p>
					<br />
					<p>I can say that this was a very good project, even if the results aren't very accurate. It allowed me to:</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>to learn to use automl tools</li>
						<li>get a deeper understanding of python (even if it isn&#39;t my favourite language)</li>
						<li>get a deeper understanding of stuff models</li>
